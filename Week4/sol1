We first fit a 15th order polynomial model using the 'sqft_living' column of the 'sales' data frame, with a tiny L2 penalty applied.
b

Next, we split the sales data frame into four subsets (set_1, set_2, set_3, set_4) and fit a 15th order polynomial model using each of the subsets.
b


For the models learned in each of these training sets, what are the largest value you learned for the coefficient of feature power_1? Choose the range that contains this value.
f

For the models learned with the high level of regularization in each of these training sets, what are the smallest value you learned for the coefficient of feature power_1? Choose the range that contains this value.
b
(This is wrong)
value is 1.9


For the models learned with the high level of regularization in each of these training sets, what are the largest value you learned for the coefficient of feature power_1? Choose the range that contains this value.
d

What is the best value for the L2 penalty according to 10-fold validation?
c
a
b

Using the best L2 penalty found above, train a model using all training data. Which of the following ranges contains the RSS on the TEST data of the model you learn with this L2 penalty?
a
