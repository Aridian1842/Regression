It is always optimal to add more features to a regression model.
False

A simple model with few parameters is most likely to suffer from:
High Bias

A complex model with many parameters is most likely to suffer from:
High Variance

A model with many parameters that fits training data very well but does poorly on test data is considered to be
overfitted

A common process for selecting a parameter like the optimal polynomial degree is:
Minimizing validation error

Should never by done
Provides an overly optimistic assessment of performance of the resulting model
