What is the Euclidean distance between the query house and the 10th house of the training set? Enter your 
answer in American-style decimals (e.g. 0.044) rounded to 3 decimal places.
0.0597


Among the first 10 training houses, which house is the closest to the query house? Enter the 0-based index of the closest house.
8

Take the query house to be third house of the test set (features_test[2]). What is the (0-based) index of the house in the training set that is closest to this query house?
382

Take the query house to be third house of the test set (features_test[2]). What is the predicted value of the query house based on 1-nearest neighbor regression? Enter your answer in simple decimals without comma separators (e.g. 300000), rounded to nearest whole number.
249000

Take the query house to be third house of the test set (features_test[2]). Which of the following is NOT part of the 4 training houses closest to the query house? (Note that all indices are 0-based.)
c

Take the query house to be third house of the test set (features_test[2]). Predict the value of the query house by the simple averaging method. Enter your answer in simple decimals without comma separators (e.g. 241242), rounded to nearest whole number.
413987

What is the index of the house in this query set that has the lowest predicted value? Enter an index between 0 and 9.
